H4DQM repository.

Below are instructions on how to get a local workspace. 


git clone https://github.com/cmsromadaq/H4DQM.git


cd H4DQM


make


After that, the bin folder should be filled with objects and executables. If you execute 'make' again, it should work. 


Run things from the H4DQM folder with something like ./scripts/runLocal.sh so everything is in the directory they should be.
